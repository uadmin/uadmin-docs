uadmin.Action
-------------
`Back To Top`_

Action is the process of doing something where you can check the status of your activities in the uAdmin project.

Type:

.. code-block:: go

    int

There are 12 types of actions:

* **Added** - Saved a new record
* **Custom** - For any other action that you would like to log
* **Deleted** - Deleted a record
* **GetSchema** - Opened the full schema of the model
* **LoginDenied** - User invalid login
* **LoginSuccessful** - User login
* **Logout** - User logout
* **Modified** - Save an existing record
* **PasswordResetDenied** - A password reset attempt was rejected
* **PasswordResetRequest** - A password reset was received
* **PasswordResetSuccessful** - A password was reset
* **Read** - Opened a record

Open "LOGS" in the uAdmin dashboard. You can see the Action field inside it as shown below.

Now go to the main.go. Let's add each methods of actions in the log.

.. code-block:: go

    func main(){
        // Some codes
        for i := 0; i < 12; i++ {
            // Initialize the log model
            log := uadmin.Log{}

            // Call each methods of action based on the specific loop count
            switch i {
            case 0:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).Added()
            case 1:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).Custom()
            case 2:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).Deleted()
            case 3:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).GetSchema()
            case 4:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).LoginDenied()
            case 5:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).LoginSuccessful()
            case 6:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).Logout()
            case 7:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).Modified()
            case 8:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).PasswordResetDenied()
            case 9:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).PasswordResetRequest()
            case 10:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).PasswordResetSuccessful()
            default:
                log.Action = uadmin.Action(0).Read()
            }

            // Add the method to the logs
            log.Save()
        }
    }

Once you are done, rebuild your application. Check your "LOGS" again to see the result.

        Username  string    `uadmin:"filter;read_only"`
        Action    Action    `uadmin:"filter;read_only"`
        TableName string    `uadmin:"filter;read_only"`
        TableID   int       `uadmin:"filter;read_only"`
        Activity  string    `uadmin:"code;read_only" gorm:"type:longtext"`
        RollBack  string    `uadmin:"link;"`
        CreatedAt time.Time `uadmin:"filter;read_only"`
    }

There are 12 types of actions:

* **Added** - Saved a new record
* **Custom** - For any other action that you would like to log
* **Deleted** - Deleted a record

* **Modified** - Save an existing record
* **PasswordResetDenied** - A password reset attempt was rejected
* **PasswordResetRequest** - A password reset was received
* **PasswordResetSuccessful** - A password was reset
* **Read** - Opened a record

There are 5 functions that you can use in Log:

**ParseRecord** - It means to analyze a record specifically. It uses this format as shown below:

.. code-block:: go

    func(a reflect.Value, modelName string, ID uint, user *User, action Action, r *http.Request) (err error)

Parameters:

* **a reflect.Value**: An interface initialized in NewModel function
* **modelName string**: The name of the model in lowercase letters
* **ID uint**: The ID of the model
* **user \*User**: What account is using in the session
* **action Action**: An activity status
* **r \*http.Request**: A data structure that represents the client HTTP request

Go to `Example #2: ParseRecord function`_ to see how ParseRecord works.

**PasswordReset** - It keeps track when the user resets his password. It uses this format as shown below:

.. code-block:: go

    func(user string, action Action, r *http.Request) (err error)

Parameters:

* **user string**: An account username
* **action Action**: An activity status
* **r \*http.Request**: A data structure that represents the client HTTP request

Go to `Example #3: PasswordReset function`_ to see how PasswordReset works.

**Save()** - Saves the object in the database

**SignIn** - It keeps track when the user signs in his account. It uses this format as shown below:

.. code-block:: go

    func(user string, action Action, r *http.Request) (err error)

Parameters:

* **user string**: An account username
* **action Action**: An activity status
* **r \*http.Request**: A data structure that represents the client HTTP request

Go to `Example #4: SignIn function`_ to see how SignIn works.

**String()** - Returns the Log ID

uadmin.LogEdit
--------------
`Back To Top`_

LogAdd adds a log when a record is edited.

Type:

.. code-block:: go

    bool

To assign a value within an application, visit `Log Edit`_ page for an example.

.. _Log Edit: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-reference/setting.html#log-edit

To assign a value in the code, follow this approach:

Before you proceed to this example, see `uadmin.LogRead`_.

Go to the main.go and apply the LogEdit function to "true”. Put it above the uadmin.Register.

.. code-block:: go

    func main() {
        uadmin.LogAdd = false
        uadmin.LogRead = false
        uadmin.LogEdit = true // <----
        uadmin.Register(
            // Some codes
        )

Run your application and go to "LOGS" model.

Suppose that you have this record in your logs as shown below:

.. image:: /assets/logreadfalseresult.png

|

Go back to uAdmin dashboard then select "TODOS".

.. image:: /assets/todoshighlightedlog.png

|

Select any of your existing data (e.g. Build a robot)

.. image:: /assets/todoexistingdata.png

|

Change it to "Assembling the CPU" for instance.

.. image:: /assets/assemblingthecpu.png

|

Result

.. image:: /assets/assemblingthecpuoutput.png

|

Now go back to the "LOGS" to see the result.

.. image:: /assets/logedittrueresult.png

|

Exit your application for a while. Go to the main.go once again. This time, apply the LogEdit function to "false".

.. code-block:: go

    func main() {
        uadmin.LogAdd = false
        uadmin.LogRead = false
        uadmin.LogEdit = false // <----
        uadmin.Register(
            // Some codes
        )

Rebuild and run your application. Go to "TODOS" model and modify any of your existing data (e.g. Assembling the CPU).

.. image:: /assets/buildarobot.png

|

Change it to "Washing the dishes" for instance.

.. image:: /assets/washingthedishes.png

|

Result

.. image:: /assets/washingthedishesresult.png

|

Now go back to the "LOGS" to see the result.

.. image:: /assets/logeditfalseresult.png

As you can see, the log content remains the same. Well done!

See `uadmin.LogDelete`_ for the continuation.
